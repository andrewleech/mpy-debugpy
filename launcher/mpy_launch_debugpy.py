"""Single parameterised boot script for MicroPython debugpy sessions.

Usage: mpy_launch_debugpy.py [target_module] [target_method] [port] [dap_stream] [loop]

Every argument is positional, so one that is not given but is followed by one
that is has to be passed as the empty string; an empty `port` or `dap_stream`
reads the same as leaving it off the end.

The bind address is probed at runtime rather than passed in: boards with a
`network` module report their own address, everything else binds all
interfaces. No device IP is hardcoded by the caller; the port, if given, is
supplied by the caller (0 is rejected by `debugpy.listen()` on every current
MicroPython port, since none implements `socket.getsockname()`). The actual
bound endpoint plus the probed firmware capabilities are reported in a
single machine-readable handshake line on stdout, printed as soon as the
socket is bound and before any client has attached:

    MPDBG-READY {"host": "...", "port": ..., "caps": {...}}

Tooling parses that one line rather than any of the human-readable banner
text around it. `wait_for_client()` (not a fixed sleep) blocks until the DAP
client has finished configuring breakpoints, so breakpoints set before then
are already applied by the time the target starts running.

`dap_stream`, when given, moves the DAP channel off TCP and onto a byte
stream: `"repl"` shares the stream this script was launched over, and
anything else is a path this runtime can open. Either way `host`/`port` in
the handshake become `"serial"`/`0` and the `port` argument goes unused. A
caller that asks for a stream and does not get one is told so: this never
falls back to TCP behind the caller's back, because the caller has a bridge
waiting on the stream and nothing listening on a port. `caps["repl_dap"]`
reports whether this run split the REPL stream - a property of the session
rather than of the build, and the channel a board with one UART and no
network has. It is the only one that changes what the REPL itself can do
while a session is live (see the `debug` section of the mpremote docs).

`loop`, when the literal `"loop"`, keeps the process and the DAP session alive
across re-runs of the target: the DAP `restart` request is advertised and
honoured, and each restart evicts whatever the target imported from
`sys.modules` and imports it again, so a source edit takes effect with no
upload and no reset. Each re-run announces itself with

    MPDBG-RESTART {"iteration": N, "evicted": [...]}

which is deliberately not another MPDBG-READY: the endpoint has not changed.
That line goes to the client's debug console as well as to stdout, because a
mounted serial session's host never sees anything the device prints.

    The channel a board with one UART and no network has. What makes it
    possible is that on some ports the runtime's console is a Python object in
    a `dupterm` slot, so replacing it with a framing wrapper puts DAP on the
    same wire and leaves program output on it too, marked apart. Where the
    slot is empty the runtime writes to its console directly and no Python
    object can intercept it, so this refuses rather than handing back a stream
    that would carry nothing: rp2 and esp32 build one slot and the REPL is not
    in it, and the unix port has no `dupterm` at all.

    The REPL is displaced for the length of the session. On stm32, installing
    anything in the slot detaches the interface from the REPL
    (`usb_vcp_attach_to_repl(vcp, false)`), which stops the interrupt
    character being scanned, so Ctrl-C reaches the target as data instead of
    raising `KeyboardInterrupt`. The mpremote docs state that trade-off.

    Which is why the stream must be able to say when the host has let go. On
    every other channel a session that waits forever costs nothing the user
    cannot walk away from; on this one it holds the console the board is
    reached by, and Ctrl-C cannot end it. A stream with no `isconnected` is
    refused here rather than taken and never given back.
